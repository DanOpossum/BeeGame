Project description:

This was a project designed to learn more about c++ and modern c++. 
It was used to learn game design from the ground up, rather than using extensive tools like Unity or Unreal, this project was used to learn how a game engine might work.

Dr. Brian Malloy of Clemson University taught game engine and c++ concepts and gave pointers and feedback through the development of this project.

All assets were designed by me except the song Flight of the Bumblebee, that was Rimsky-Korsakov.

Game:
  Bee vs flies
  The objective of the Bee is to defeat all the flies before the flies defeat the bee.
